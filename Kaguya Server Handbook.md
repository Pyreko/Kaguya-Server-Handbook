# Kaguya Server Handbook

## Introduction

This server can be considered the one and only official unofficial Kaguya Discord server, created on 29th of June, 2017.

The server is closely affiliated with /r/Kaguya_sama. Guya.moe, the (best) manga reader, was created here as well.

Student Council is the admin role and Discipline Committee is the moderator role, but feel free to ping any one of us if someone is breaking rules or intervention is needed.

We value productive discussion and mindless fun alike, but this is a public place, so try to keep the degeneracy on the low side.

## Series info

Kaguya-sama Wants to Be Confessed To: The Geniuses' War of Love and Brains *(Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen)*, also translated as *Kaguya-sama: Love is War*, is a romcom manga about two tsunderes trying to make each other confess.

Kaguya is a **weekly** manga, but the author (or the magazine) takes [breaks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CUSvIvn1zg7Jq0HQW7vIlnIFMvy8b9HEqqbgbMLEFxw/edit#gid=0) sometimes. Latest chapter releases are mainly translated by the *Fans Scans | Jaimini's~Box~* scanlation group. The official release rights belong to VIZ Media, so far they have released 14 volumes out of 20.

The Japanese release is on Wednesday midnight JST every week, and as scanlation takes some time, you can generally expect the translated chapters around Thursday. 

You can read the manga, find all the info about anime-adapted chapters, get links to buy the manga and so on on https://guya.moe, which had been created for this very purpose. Mangadex is missing many chapters because Jaiminis' Box pulled out of there, and they too don't have all the chapters on their [website](jaiminisbox.com/) because they only started translating from chapter 89. Guya has it all.

The series has two spin-offs by other mangaka: lewd and stupid Official Doujin and We Want to Talk About Kaguya spin-off, which follows the main manga chapters from the viewpoint of Mass Media club duo, Erika and Karen. 

##### Raws and leaks

As this series is very popular, there is an interesting thing going on: way before Wednesday, when the official release is supposed to happen, someone obtains Young Jump magazines, scans them and gives to Korean and Chinese teams for translation. This results in Korean and Chinese scans being available as early as Monday. Before that, they leak panels and text descriptions which we discuss in #raw-spoilers. As soon as CN/KR scans are available, we translate them in an imgur gallery. The translation as it comes from Japanese to Chinese/Korean to English usually contains a lot of mistakes.

Sometimes someone takes these approximate translations and makes a typesetted release out of them. We look down on these and disallow discussing them on the server except in #raw-spoilers - all until a Japanese -> English translation of good quality is available.

## Ai bot

Our server bot is @AiBot#4421.

To get comprehensive help, type `.help` in #bot-channel.

If Ai command requires a `@user`, you can instead use their user ID so you don't ping them (enable Developer Mode in your Discord to be able to copy the IDs for users).

#### `.gc`  ::  Guyacoin

GC is server's virtual currency.  It has no connection to real money, they are tokens you can get for talking in the server.

100 <:gc:680807090805407826> = 10 <:gs:680807165530734600> = 10 <:gg:680807013214847000> = <:gp:680807224549179491>

You get GC by discussing, but you earn less GC by shitposting - earning it this way is called *mining* in analogy with cryptocurrencies. Don't try to guess how the mining algorithm works, it is far too advanced.

You cannot earn GC in #general and #memes.

When sending money, use the format of `10p 1g 2s 15c` - a number of coins with the coin name after it.

You can also react with a coin emote to someone to send them that coin.

`.help gc`  ::  Help with GC usage.
`.gc`  ::  Show your current balance.	
`.gc send @user Xc (Xs / Xg / Xp) `  ::  Send money to someone.
`.gc tip @user`  ::  Send 1 copper to someone.
`.gc loan`  ::  Loan related commands. `.help gc loan` to see more details.

#### `.club`  ::  Clubs system

You can create clubs and join them. Clubs are used to create groups of people who want to be notified about something - you can `.ping` a club and it will ping all its members. If you create a club, you are the club president.

Club creation costs 20 :gc:. Club will be sent for approval after creation and could be deleted by mods if it serves no purpose.

Large clubs can be turned into roles by mods. These clubs will lose user blacklist functionality.

## Introduction

This server can be considered the one and only official unofficial Kaguya Discord server, created on ++the++ 29th of June, 2017.

The server is closely affiliated with /r/Kaguya_sama. <!--++added link++--> [Guya.moe](https://guya.moe), the (best) manga reader, was created here as well.

Student Council is the admin role and Discipline Committee is the moderator role, but feel free to ping any one of us if someone is breaking rules or intervention is needed.

We value productive discussion and mindless fun alike, but this is a public place, so try to keep the degeneracy on the low side.

## Series info

Kaguya-sama Wants to Be Confessed To: The Geniuses' War of Love and Brains *(Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen)*, ~~also~~ ++officially++ translated as *Kaguya-sama: Love is War*, is a romcom manga about two tsunderes trying to make each other confess.

Kaguya is a **weekly** manga, but the author (or the magazine) takes [breaks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CUSvIvn1zg7Jq0HQW7vIlnIFMvy8b9HEqqbgbMLEFxw/edit#gid=0) sometimes. ~~Latest~~ ++The most recent++ chapter releases are mainly translated by the *Jaimini's Box* scanlation group. The official release rights belong to VIZ Media ~~,~~ ++;++ so far they have released 14 volumes out of 20.

The Japanese release is on Wednesday midnight JST every week, and as scanlation takes some time, you can generally expect the translated chapters ++sometime on++ ~~around~~ Thursday. 

<!-- Feels weird to read, possibly because of the "so on on", which makes sense when you read it out loud but ugh-->
~~You can read the manga, find all the info about anime-adapted chapters, get links to buy the manga and so on on https://guya.moe, which had been created for this very purpose.~~++You can read the manga, find information on anime-adapted chapters, get links to buy the manga, and much more on https://guya.moe, which has been created for this very purpose.++ Mangadex is missing many chapters because Jaiminis' Box pulled out of there, and they  don't have all the chapters on their [website](jaiminisbox.com/) as well because they started translating from chapter 89. Guya has it all. <!--#NotAGuyaAd-->


~~The series has two spin-offs by other mangaka: lewd and stupid Official Doujin and We Want to Talk About Kaguya spin-off, which follows the main manga chapters from the viewpoint of Mass Media club duo, Erika and Karen.~~

++The series has two spin-offs by two other mangaka: the lewder, stupider and non-canon Official Doujin (ended) and the canon We Want to Talk About Kaguya 4-koma, starring Erika and Karen, the Mass Media Club duo.++

### Raws and leaks

<!-- I mostly want to fix the last sentence tbh-->
~~As this series is very popular, there is an interesting thing going on: way before Wednesday, when the official release is supposed to happen, someone obtains Young Jump magazines, scans them and gives to Korean and Chinese teams for translation. This results in Korean and Chinese scans being available as early as Monday. Before that, they leak panels and text descriptions which we discuss in #raw-spoilers. As soon as CN/KR scans are available, we translate them in an imgur gallery. The translation as it comes from Japanese to Chinese/Korean to English usually contains a lot of mistakes.~~

++Due to huge popularity, the official Wednesday release is usually preceded by early acquisition of the Young Jump magazines, which is eventually passed to Korean and Chinese teams for their native translation. This results in Korean and Chinese scans being available earlier than the Japanese version, sometimes as early as Monday. When these panels and text descriptions get leaked, we discuss them in #raw-spoilers; as soon as CN/KR scans are available, we translate them in an Imgur gallery. Because this translation is from Japanese to Chinese/Korean to English, it usually contains mistakes or nuances lost in translation.++

~~Sometimes someone takes these approximate translations and makes a typesetted release out of them. We look down on these and disallow discussing them on the server except in #raw-spoilers - all until a Japanese -> English translation of good quality is available.~~

++Sometimes, someone uses these approximate translations and releases a typeset version, even before the usual scanlation team gets the original Japanese release to work with (this is called *sniping*). Due to these usually being of low quality in terms of translation and typesetting, we look down on them and disallow their discussion anywhere except in #raw-spoilers.++

## Ai Bot

Our ~~overlord~~ server bot is @AiBot#4421.  ++This is a private bot, and as such is not available for public use.++

To get help with the bot and its commands, type `.help` in #bot-channel.

~~If Ai command requires a `@user`, you can instead use their user ID so you don't ping them (enable Developer Mode in your Discord to be able to copy the IDs for users).~~

++If an Ai command requires tagging a user, you can avoid pinging them by using their user ID instead. You can get this by [enabling Developer Mode in Discord](https://discordia.me/en/developer-mode).++

### `.gc`  ::  Guyacoin

~~GC is server's virtual currency.  It has no connection to real money,     they are tokens you can get for talking ~~in~~ ++on++ the server.~~

++Guyacoin, or GC, is the server's virtual currency. GC are virtual tokens that you can earn by talking in the server. They are not linked to any real-world currency.++

100 <:gc:680807090805407826> = 1 <:gs:680807165530734600> 

10 <:gs:680807165530734600> = 1 <:gg:680807013214847000> 

10 <:gg:680807013214847000> = 1 <:gp:680807224549179491>

You get GC by discussing, but you earn less GC by shitposting - earning it this way is called *mining* in analogy with cryptocurrencies. Don't try to guess how the mining algorithm works ~~,~~ ++;++ it is far too advanced. ++Spamming for GC will not help you either.++

You cannot earn GC in #general and #memes.

When sending money, use the format of `10p 1g 2s 15c` - a number of coins with the coin name after it.  ++You can also react with a coin emote to someone to send them that coin.  *You can't revoke a transaction.*++

### `.club`  ::  Clubs system

<!--I moved the club creation/join blurb down, as the first paragraph seems to be more about "what are clubs", and the second is "here's how to manage clubs"-->
~~You can create clubs and join them.~~ Clubs are used to create groups of people who want to be notified about something - you can `.ping` a club and it will ping all its members. If you create a club, you are the club president.

Club creation costs 20 :gc: ++(nonrefundable)++. A club will be sent for approval after creation and could be deleted by mods if it serves no purpose.  The basic commands to use clubs are as follows (replace `<club name` with the appropriate club name):
